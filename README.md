cHex is a Foundry VTT module that improves on the existing grid system.

It enables a persistent hexagonal grid linked to a scene, which tracks terrain, traveling difficulty, improvements, ownership and so on...
It is designed in a way that makes it highly customizable:

Additional Terrains, features, realms (kingdoms and empires) and resources can be configured and linked to the grid.

A drawing palette allows for quick and easy drawing of realms and terrain:

A number of different layers allows for a quick and easy overview:

So far the layers are:
- Realm layer
- Terrain layer
- Travel difficulty layer

Improvements can provide a multitude of resources and even decrease the difficulty of travel in the hex:

The realm palette tool allows to generate a report of the produced resources:
